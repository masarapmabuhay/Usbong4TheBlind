We originally made this app for our partner, Ephpheta Foundation for the Blind, Inc., to help the blind/visually impaired complete secondary education.

What it does:<br>
Converts Filipino .txt files into .3gp audio files

The ingenious thing about this is that instead of using the default English accent for its Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, we used a Spanish accent, and then modified the input text.

For example, Usbong4TheBlind automatically changes "halaman" to "jalaman", because in Spanish "h" is silent.

Our founder, Michael B. Syson, presented this in June 2013, at the University of Washington: Symposium on Disability, Technology and Rehabilitation in Low and Middle Income Countries.

Indeed, our love for learning languages, coupled with knowledge and understanding of ICT, can be harnessed for social good.
